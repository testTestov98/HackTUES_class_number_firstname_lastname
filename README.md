DONE

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's coming home with his next grasp to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chest match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says the relationship hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to Spiderman
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said "Bye Suzanne" after the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
One-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was come sunlight, scram
Now we hug tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her, too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turnin' into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like a church at the pew
And now that I got you, I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and breach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit, fuck
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My name's (ooh)
My name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh)
Call me (ooh)
River (ooh)
We'll let the river run
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
What can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave
I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice maybe
That's why I may have came you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda' loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort
But fuck it, what's one more lie to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something (I'm sorry, I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
